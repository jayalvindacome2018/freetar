Freetar is a Free open-source game based on the gameplay set forth in the hit Playstation 2 game 'Guitar Hero'. It supports a large variety of gamepad configurations (as well as the Guitar Hero controller with a Playstation -> USB adapter).

The Freetar Editor is a closely related project that allows users to create songs for Freetar from songs on their computers - allowing a near unlimited number of songs.

**Note from Administrator**: This project is pretty much dead at this point. I am unable to update it due to legal obligations. There is an alternative editor (EOF) that (as far as I can tell) much more robust available at: http://www.t3-i.com/eof.htm . I'm sorry I didn't update this sooner. :(
