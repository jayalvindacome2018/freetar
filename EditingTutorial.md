# Beginning Editing Tutorial #

This a basic tutorial to help people who just started using Freetar Editor

Before we begin, you should look at the List of Menu Functions to learn what everything does.

First, download this Song. It is a chromatic scale. When you downloaded the song, go to the Freetar Editor and click on New Song under file. Find where you downloaded the song and double click to open it.

First off, set your control buttons. This is done under options. A good place to put them is having 1 being Play Note 1, 2 being Play Note 2, 3 being Play Note 3, 4 being Play Note 4, 5 being Play Note 5, and 0 being Strum. Next, go to song properties and set the beats per second to 8 because this song is very easy. When you do harder songs, you can keep this at 16 or even go to 32 beats per second. To make it easier to make notes accurate there is a way you can get the beats per second to match the song tempo, but we won't go there yet.

Now, still in song properties, set the Allowable Error Time to 0.05. This way, the note animation (note getting bigger) will happen very quickly and make it easier to tell if the note is accurate with the music. Also, go to playback and click "press button to record mode" so you can record notes by pressing the buttons you configured.

Next, play the song. When you hear the first note, pause the song and press 1 to create a green note. Go back to the beginning of the song and set the speed to 1/2 time by going to the "playback" menu. Now play the song again and check if it is accurate. If not, play it back again and correct it by moving the note forwards or backwards. If you did this correctly, the note should be 3 beats from the beginning of the song.

Now, do the same thing for 7 more notes. If you did it correctly, the 8th note should be on the 0:9 mark located at the bottom.

Now that 8 notes are in rhythm, let's change what track they are on instead of 8 Green notes. To move the notes, highlight them by clicking on them and press up or down to move them around on different tracks. The 1st note can stay green because it's the 1st note and there are no notes lower than it in the passage. The 2nd note will become Red because the guitar is playing higher. The 3rd note will become Yellow, the 4th note will become Blue, and the 5th note will become Orange. Now that you can't go any higher, you go back to Green. So, the 6th note is Green, the 7th note is Red, and the 8th note is Yellow.

Since the song notes are long and the editor notes are short, you should make them longer. Highlight the 1st note. Now press and hold ctrl and tap right till you are one beat from the next note. Do that for the rest of the notes. For the 8th note, press right 9 times.

After all that, let's play the song. Go back to song properties and set the Allowable Error Time back to .25. Go to playback and click on "Practice Mode". Also, in playback, set the speed of the song back to normal. Go to the beginning of the song and press play. When the green note crosses the red line, press 1 and 0 at the same time. When the red note crosses the red line, press 2 and 0 at the same time. When the yellow note crosses the red line, press 3 and 0 at the same time. When the blue note crosses the red line, press 4 and 0 at the same time. When the orange note crosses the red line, press 5 and 0 at the same time. Do the same with the last 3 notes. If you played a note correctly, it will be green. If you played it incorrectly, it will be red.

If you wish to finish this song, go ahead. Keep the same pattern going till the last note. In future songs you will make, there will be chords. To make a chord, record two notes on the same line.

Congratulations! Your now ready to make songs using the Freetar Editor.
